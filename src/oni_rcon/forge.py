"""ReclaimerForge (www.reclaimerforge.net): the community catalog of forged maps, gametypes and playlists, read with
the operator's own API key. No key ships with oni-rcon, and it asks for nothing past catalog:read and assets:download.

From the developer docs: a Bearer key over HTTPS; 120 requests per 60 s per key, reported in X-RateLimit-Limit,
-Remaining and -Reset, and Retry-After on a 429; GET /api/listings (page_size, updated_since, sort, window),
/api/listings/{id}/versions/{version}/manifest and /api/listings/changes (updated_since, then the first page's as_of
as updated_before on the pages after it).

ASSUMED, until checked against the OpenAPI schema (forgefake.py serves exactly these):
- GET /api/listings/{id} gives one listing with its "versions".
- a page is {"items": [...], "next_cursor": ...}, and the next one is asked for with cursor=...
- GET /api/listings takes q= to search, and window= only with the sorts in WINDOWED.
- a manifest is {"reference", "assets": [{"path", "url", "size", "sha256"}]}, the reference being the name the
  dedicated server lists the map or gametype under once it has the files.
- a change is {"listing_id", "version_id", "change", "updated_at"}, change being "version_published", "updated" or
  "withdrawn"; a listing's "status" reads "withdrawn" once it is.
Field names are read tolerantly, as app.py reads the server's, so another spelling of the same thing still works.

Blocking HTTP (urllib) in threads, like update.py: nothing for the frozen build to miss, and 120 requests a minute
needs no connection pool.
